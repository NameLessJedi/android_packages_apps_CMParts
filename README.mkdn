===================

What is CMParts on Steroids
---------------------------
This is enhanced version of original CMParts.
Enhancement are:
* ability to control Swap usage (toggle that sets persist.sys.swap property - needs script in /etc/init.d)

* ability to set and restore on boot CPU frequencies and governor. No matter what you set in preferences restoring will be disabled if /data/.nocpu or /sd-ext/.nocpu files exist (think about them as safety valeves". This files can be made in Recovery mode either manually or by flashing nocpu-restore.zip (provided in repo).
